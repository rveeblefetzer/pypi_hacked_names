# pypi_hacked_names

This project was written to help protect innocent python developers who happen
to make a typo in a library name and install a malicious package out of PYPI.

# Purpose
The goal of this program is to automatically find possible compromises 
with installed packages.

# How to use
**Note:** `hack_check.py` is written to support python version 2.7.x.

1. Clone the repo or download `hack_check.py` and `malicious_names.json` to the
   same directory.

2. In each project, activate the virtual environrment and then run `python2
   path/to/your/hack_check.py`.
    
   The output will look something like this in verbose mode:

3.  If you do have a potentially compromised library, donâ€™t use `pip uninstall`
    as it runs code in the package. Go in the directory and delete the package.
